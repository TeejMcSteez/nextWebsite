# Website Goals

After talking to another student (shoutout https://pvi.sh) I found Next.js which is like Svelte but a little more chonky

## TODO

1. Add typewriter effect to About me section.
2. Figure out how one would like to do project I like the peers idea of having a list. Wonder if I could pull from my public github repos to use what I already have as a link to it and use the readme as a description We shall see.
3. Add a proper blog route section whether I want to use my current Supabase setup or think of a new one
4. Add skill section also figure out if I want to make it a GUI thing for me or have to edit the source code.
