# Website Goals

After talking to another student (shoutout https://pvi.sh) I found Next.js

Made me want to re-build my website with Next.js because I already deploy with Vercel so why not use their framework as well!

## TODO

1. Create Typewriter hook that responds with the intervals to typewrite at a speed passed to it. Instead of baking the typewriter function into the about page it lets me use it anywhere
