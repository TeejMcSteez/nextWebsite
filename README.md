# Website Goals

After talking to another student (shoutout https://pvi.sh) I found Next.js

Made me want to re-build my website with Next.js because I already deploy with Vercel so why not use their framework as well!

## TODO

1. Add typewriter effect to About me section. ✔️
2. Figure out how one would like to do project I like the peers idea of having a list. Wonder if I could pull from my public github repos to use what I already have as a link to it and use the readme as a description We shall see. ✔️
3. Add a proper blog route section whether I want to use my current Supabase setup or think of a new one ✔️
4. Add skill section also figure out if I want to make it a GUI thing for me or have to edit the source code. ✔️
5. Think of animation or feature I want to add with other React componenets such as [React Bits](https://www.reactbits.dev/text-animations/ascii-text) ✔️ (Decided to use framer motion)
6. Update menu button to be more interactive on mobile ✔️
