                    I am passionate about web development and security, while in school I have mainly stuck with web development to learn how to program and how computers work in general I aim to learn more about 
                    cybersecurity.

                    Aside from my time programming and in school I enjoy working with hardware to such as building computers (up to 6 now) as well as playing with microcontrollers like the ESP32. I also enjoy 3D printing parts and useful little things like a Xbox controller holder.
